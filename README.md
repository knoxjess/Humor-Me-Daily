# Initial setup

Create an '.env' file in the main directory path and include the following data:

```
DB_NAME='your_database_name'
DB_USER='your_mysql_username'
DB_PW='your_mysql_password'
```

Once your '.env' has been created with the corresponding data, open up the schema ('db/schema.sql') and update the database label to match with the database you included in your '.env' file.

# Database reset

Before seeding the data, make sure to reset the database by setting 'force: false' to 'true' in the 'server.js' file and type this command in terminal:

```
npm start
```

After that, revert back to 'false' and exit the server by typing

```
control + c
```

# Seeding starter data into database and starting the server

To seed the database with the starter data, type this command in terminal:

```
npm run seeds
```

To start the server, type in terminal:

```
npm start
```

From there, you are ready to use the application!
